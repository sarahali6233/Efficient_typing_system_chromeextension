# Product Requirements Document (PRD) for Chrome Extension: Efficient Typing System

## Overview

The Chrome extension aims to enhance typing efficiency by utilizing a shorthand-based system. It is designed to cater to various user needs by allowing customization and personalization while maintaining an intuitive and modern UI.

---

## Functional Requirements

### 1. **Language Selection**

- Users must be able to select their preferred language from a list.
- The extension should support multiple languages with relevant shorthand rules for each.

### 2. **Profile Management**

- Users can create multiple profiles.
  - Each profile should have a specific purpose (e.g., work, school, personal, or custom cases).
- Users should be able to easily switch between profiles based on their activity.

### 3. **Occupation-Based Personalization**

- Users can specify their occupation (e.g., student, developer, doctor, journalist) or the specific task they are doing.
- The extension should tailor shortcuts to suit the user’s chosen occupation or activity.
  - Example: Doctors typing medical terms or developers typing code snippets.

### 4. **Shorthand Typing Features**

The extension should support the following shorthand mechanisms:

#### 4.1 **Phonetic Representation**

- Convert words based on phonetics (e.g., "fotograf" → "photograph" or "enuf" → "enough").

#### 4.2 **Letter Reduction**

- Reduce words by omitting vowels while preserving meaning (e.g., "mnmnt" → "monument").

#### 4.3 **Rule-Based Expansions**

- Automatically expand standard prefixes and suffixes based on predefined rules.
  - Example: "tion" → "tn" or "ing" → "ng".

#### 4.4 **Common Word Abbreviations and Slang**

- Expand common abbreviations and slang.
  - Example: "u" → "you" or "r" → "are".

#### 4.5 **Logical Word Forms**

- Allow users to create logical word forms:
  - Example: "diff" → "different," "dfrns" → "difference."
- Enable grouping related words under a single shortcut:
  - Example: "diff+" expands to "different," "difference," or "differential," based on context.

### 5. **AI Dynamic Expansions**

- Integrate AI to analyze content and expand words appropriately based on the context.
  - Example: "diff" in a technical document could expand to "differential" rather than "different."

### 6. **Typing Efficiency Tracking**

- Gamify the experience by providing metrics on typing efficiency improvements.
  - Example: Display statistics such as words per minute (WPM), time saved, and most-used shortcuts.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### 1. **Performance**

- The extension must process typing in real-time with minimal latency.
- It should operate seamlessly across various web applications.

### 2. **Platform Compatibility**

- The extension must be compatible with the latest versions of Chrome.

### 3. **User Interface (UI)**

- The UI should feel intuitive and modern.
  - Clean, minimalist design.
  - Easy navigation between settings, profiles, and analytics.

### 4. **Security**

- Ensure user data (e.g., profiles, shortcuts) is stored securely.
- Provide an option to back up and restore profiles.

## Technical Requirements

### 1. **Technology Stack**

- Use Python fast API for backend processing.
- Chrome Extension APIs for integration with the browser.
- Use react for UI.

### 2. **Shorthand Rule Engine**

- Implement a rule engine in Python to handle predefined shorthand expansions.
- AI models (e.g., using TensorFlow or PyTorch) to handle dynamic content analysis and expansions.

### 3. **Efficiency Tracker**

- Use a lightweight database (e.g., SQLite) to store user performance metrics.
- Render efficiency stats using charting libraries (e.g., Chart.js or D3.js).

## Development Milestones

### Phase 1: Core Functionalities

- Language selection.
- Profile creation and management.
- Basic shorthand rules (phonetic representation, letter reduction).

### Phase 2: Advanced Features

- Occupation-based personalization.
- Common abbreviations and logical word forms.
- AI-based dynamic expansions.

### Phase 3: Gamification and UI Enhancements

- Efficiency tracking and gamification.
- Finalize UI design and optimization.

## Notes

- Testing should include both functional and UI/UX evaluations.
- Gather user feedback during beta testing to refine shorthand rules and AI expansions.
